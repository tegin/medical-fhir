This resource is used to record detailed information about a condition,
problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept
that has risen to a level of concern.

It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from
application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic
findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a
practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated
and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require
ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern).

The condition resource may be used to record a certain health state of a
patient which does not normally present a negative outcome, e.g. pregnancy.
The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a
procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation
procedure.

While conditions are frequently a result of a clinician's assessment and
assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health, conditions
can also be expressed by the patient, related person, or any care team member.
A clinician may have a concern about a patient condition (e.g. anorexia) that
the patient is not concerned about. Likewise, the patient may have a
condition (e.g. hair loss) that does not rise to the level of importance such
that it belongs on a practitioner’s Problem List.

For example, each of the following conditions could rise to the level of
importance such that it belongs on a problem or concern list due to its
direct or indirect impact on the patient’s health:

* Unemployed
* Without transportation (or other barriers)
* Susceptibility to falls
* Exposure to communicable disease
* Family History of cardiovascular disease
* Fear of cancer
* Cardiac pacemaker
* Amputee-BKA
* Risk of Zika virus following travel to a country
* Former smoker
* Travel to a country planned (that warrants immunizations)
* Motor Vehicle Accident
* Patient has had coronary bypass graft
